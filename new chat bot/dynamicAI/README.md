# Developing-a-Dynamic-AI-Chatbot-in-Python
Creating an AI chatbot that can take on different personas, keep track of conversation history, and provide coherent responses.

This project involves creating an AI chatbot that can take on different personas, keep track of conversation history, and provide coherent responses.

Key skills we'll practice include:

* Using the **OpenAI API** to interact with a large language model.
* Crafting and managing distinct chatbot **personas with system messages**.
* Monitoring and handling **token usage to stay within a token budget**.

### Creating the Chatbot Framework
The Chatbot Framework is implementated as a **ConversationManager** class in the module `dynamic_ai_chatbot.py`.
